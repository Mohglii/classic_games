A fun weekend project…This script was inspired and taught by YouTube programmer @techwithtim. Going into this project, I wanted to learn how to use the ’PyGame’ module. But then I quickly learned the focus of this project should be an ability to demonstrate the importance of script structure and organization and how crucial a clean composition is when coding within a large data structure containing nested functions within a Class definition. I learned intermediate to advanced level techniques such as defining a Class, manipulation of conditional statements, shifting/assortment of dictionary positions, and to capture a level understanding of the building blocks required to design a game like Tetris. Literally, no pun intended :)
